<p>      I am a postdoc in mathematics at UCLA working with 
  <a href = "https://www.math.ucla.edu/~mason/">Mason Porter! </a> My research relates to large-graph limits (graphons) and their applications.
  <br>

  Before this, I earned my PhD at Columbia University in Applied Mathematics, working with <a href = "https://www.apam.columbia.edu/faculty/qiang-du"> Qiang Du </a>. 
  <br>
  
  I also dabble in art, cycling, calisthenics, poetry-writing, and other projects.
